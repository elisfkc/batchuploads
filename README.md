Wikimedia Commons batch upload projects

Various upload projects for different online collections. Please consider one of the standard upload tools available for Commons before hacking out your own variants.

Note that Flickr and other API systems may need you to register and generate your own keys. Please do not use mine if I have left them in the code by accident!
